    "General comments": "layered\" branch of mitsuba: Compiling went fine provided CXXflags in config.py are modified from  -std=c++11 into -std=gnu++11 (ubuntu 18.04) . The branch was successfully linked against qt4 . However the interface kept crashing (failed assertion). No example scene is given so I was not able to reproduce the results. There seems to be another implementation of this work called layerlab. But this mitsuba code was the one referenced from the project's webpage.",
