    "General comments": "The provided code comes with many dependencies, which are supposedly handled using premake4.\n\nOn windows, I could generate a solution for Visual Studio by calling premake.exe vs2012 from the source code directory (call to more recent versions of VS did not work). I couldn't build the solution, as premake didn't populate the include, build and link directives for the dependencies. I tried to fix it, but I couldn't find a way to properly handle caffe and its dependencies.\n\nI got similar problems on linux, where I could generate a Makefile by calling premake gmake, but I had too many dependencies to fix when calling  make config=debug64.",
