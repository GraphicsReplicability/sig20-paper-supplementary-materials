[ STATE_CREATION ERROR #163: CREATEINPUTLAYOUT_MISSINGELEMENT]\n\nI couldn't debug this error, as I didn't know if the matching problem came from the input spire shader, or from the processes in spire that convert the spire shader to a DirectX shader.\n\nNote that the follow-up Slang (Sigg 2018) is however marked as reproducible.",
