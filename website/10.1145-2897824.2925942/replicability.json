    "General comments": "Beside the compilation of matcaffe which took me a lot of time, I had to remove the absolute paths in custom_toolboxes/scene_parsing_model/scene_parse.m. The interactive selection of the images was not working, thus I removed the call to select_image in replace_sky.m, and selected the image programatically (automatically select the first image).\n\nThe code needs a mask and a parsing image for each RGB image took as input. No code is provided to generate those, which limits its use in other contexts.",
