To be sure to run the 2016 paper, on line 10 replace model_gan.t7 by model_mse.t7 to load the provided pre-trained model . Not all figures input are given (the figs.sh script is for the 2018 paper) but the test.png corresponds to one of the example in Fig. 01. My result was more blurry than the one in the paper, and so were the results with other test images I could run.",
