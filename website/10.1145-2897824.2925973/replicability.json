I tried to setup a ubuntu14.04 virtual machine but ceres fails to build (a first issue with the packaged version of eigen which is too old and a c++ build issue later).\nOn a more recent ubuntu, I have an issue with the thirdparty targets:\n\n -- Found Ceres version: 2.0.0 installed in: /usr/local with components: [EigenSparse, SparseLinearAlgebraLibrary, LAPACK, SuiteSparse, CXSparse, SchurSpecializations]\nCMake Error at thirdparty/gflags/CMakeLists.txt:25 (ADD_LIBRARY):\n  ADD_LIBRARY cannot create target \"gflags\" because an imported target with\n  the same name already exists.\n\nI wasn't able to build the project on MacOs Catalina as well.",
