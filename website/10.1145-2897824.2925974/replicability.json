    "General comments": "The short LUA code comes with a downloadable pretrained network (the data to retrain the network is from http://places.csail.mit.edu/ but the code to train the network is not provided). I used the Ubuntu for Windows framework (with Windows 10) to run the code, which was simpler here.\nI still needed to perform a number of steps:\n- dos2unix download_model.sh to prevent including the \\r in the download URL\n- sudo apt-get install cmake and sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev for dependencies\n- installing torch with nn was slightly harder than the instructions on the torch website claim:\ngit clone https://github.com/torch/distro.git ~/torch --recursive\ncd ~/torch\nthen on line 178 of install--deps  you need to change\nsudo apt-get install -y python-software-properties\nto sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common since python-software-properties is not supported anymore.\nThen you can run bash install-deps and ./install.sh\nBut then you still need to install nn:\nsudo apt install luarocks\nsudo ~/torch/install/bin/luarocks install torch\nsudo ~/torch/install/bin/luarocks install nn\nand finally run the colorize script, not directly with \"th\" but using:\n~/torch/install/bin/th colorize.lua ansel_colorado_1941.png out.png\nThen everything works fine, runs smoothly (counts 2-3 minutes on the CPU for the only example image provided, which exactly replicate the landscape result in the teaser).",
