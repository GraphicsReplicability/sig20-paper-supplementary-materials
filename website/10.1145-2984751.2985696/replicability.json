The code does not provide any information about the build instructions and it seems that it requires an old version of libIGL (and many hardcoded path in the CMakeLists.txt).I was thus not able compile the project.\n\nThe repository seems to be down as many elements are missing: \"Future home of the open hardware specifications and software source code accompanying \"Rig Animation with a Tangible and Modular Input Device\" [Glauser et al. 2016].",
