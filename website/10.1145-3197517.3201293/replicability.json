Many other examples are provided in the scripts folder, however this requires installing taichi (a legacy branch) which fails (even after adding a -fpermissive option which suppressed some errors) with:\n\"error: no match for \u2018operator+=\u2019 (operand types are \u2018taichi::RigidBody<2>::InertiaType\u2019 {aka \u2018float\u2019} and \u2018taichi::MatrixND<2, float, taichi::InstSetExt::AVX2>\u2019)\" \n\nHence I was not able to reproduce other results using the provided scripts.",
