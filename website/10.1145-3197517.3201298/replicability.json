    "General comments": "There are multiple issues with the code. While no makefile is provided, it is relatively easy (though cumbersome because of several dependencies) to create a Visual Studio 2017 project. Not listed as a dependency is libtiff.\nIn main.cpp, due to issues with \"goto\", you need to move the declarations of data (line 142), proNo (line 148), scene (line 149), mainWindow (line 154) at the begining of the main. It should look like:\n\tVolumeData* data = new VolumeData;\n\tGLUTSceneContainer *mainWindow;\n\tint proNo;\n\tST_Tomography *scene;\naround line 49.\nIn ST_Tomography.cpp, strdup (line 188) should be replaced by _strdup because it is deprecated in Visual Studio 2017 (it produces a compilation error although the code is supposed to compile with Visual Studio 2015 and 2018 according to the Readme).\nBut then multiple files seems missing, and could either not be found on the internet (a \"linear_solver.h\" that contains a \"linear_solver\" namespace, a \"scope.h\" that includes a #define called \"utilities_scope_defines\", a file called \"image_blas.h\" that performs blas-like operations on images), or a generic and could be recoded (e.g., \"vec3.h\"). Similarly, \"str_format\" is not a standard function in Visual Studio, so I am not sure where it is supposed to come from.\nUltimately, I could not compile the code.\n\n--alternative test on linux--\nUnable to compile, had to create a CMakeLists (no build instruction), several bugfix needed: goto crosses initialization issues, includes missing (cstring) missing linear_solver.h file ...",
