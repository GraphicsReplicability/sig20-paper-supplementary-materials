I could not find the examples shown in the paper for the multicolored examples, but some images are quite similar (e.g., a different penguin, a different red car, a different crown...) and produce reasonable results.\nNote that the required numpy is version 1.16.1 and it doesn't work with 1.14.5 -- the python code is just the GUI.",
