    "General comments": "As reviewer 1, I could not build the provided Visual Studio solution (see details of my attemp below).\nHowever, it appears that the code is shipped with precompiled demos I didn't find at the first look.\nBefore running the demo, I had to install the following dependencies (tested with Python 3.6):\n>pip install image opencv-python scikit-image\nThen, to install pytorch, I followed the instructions given at https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/, for me it was\n>pip install torch===1.4.0 torchvision===0.5.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html\n\nThen you need to download and put the data as described here: https://github.com/msracver/Deep-Exemplar-based-Colorization#download-models\n\nAnd then simply run the script demo\\run.bat. It should output two colored images in demo\\examples\\res\\.\n\nCompilation attempt:\n=================\nI could however compile caffe and other dependencies using CK (https://codereef.ai/portal/c/032630d041b4fd8a:7d5e081bda47dcbc/), namely opencv, boost, gflags, glogs, hd5f, lmbd and protobuf. I had to install precompiled version of \n\n\n---- Review 2 -----\nCould not test on Windows because Caffe is unavailable for VS2017. I spent multiple hours trying to compile Caffe with VS2017, but stopped after compiling the 13th dependency, ATLAS, that compiles unix-style with cygwin. Pre-built binaries *may* be found for VS2015. Caffe is not maintained as of 2019.",
