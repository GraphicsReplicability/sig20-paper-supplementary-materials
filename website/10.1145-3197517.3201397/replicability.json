    "General comments": "All scripts are provided for reproducing the examples in the paper.\nThe dependencies can be easily installed using a script, but on ubuntu 19.10 I had to install libnlopt-cxx-dev.\nThe policy learning went well, but I was not able to produce the results of the paper, due to the failure of the test_policy function with error: Attempted to look up malformed environment ID: b'../data/precomp_data/dog_run1/policy_params.pkl'. (Currently all IDs must be of the form ^(?:[\\w:-]+\\/)?([\\w:.-]+)-v(\\d+)$.)\nThis occured also when testing the provided precomputed policies.\n\nI also tried with an older release of dart-env (v0.7.4 - 2017) which seems to be handling registration but the same problem occured.",
